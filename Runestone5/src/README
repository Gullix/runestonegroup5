From the website you can press a button such "MOVE" and then tell the robot to move
in a particular direction. 

Levels ~> 	MOVE: to move it manually 
			PICKUP: should bring bricks into warehouse and viceversa 
		  	DONE: close connection 
		  	GOTO: double coordinates system! Simply goes into a direction
		  	
MOVE ~> LEFT, RIGHT, FORWARD, BACKWARD

The robot follows the lines (only black and white). To be sure now we're going to add
some new colors that are really different in a RGB spectrum in order to not have the
robot be confused and fall in error easily.
Like taking into consideration YELLOW and NAVY_BLUE.
